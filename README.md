# Hackathon

PotatoCo is a major food distribution chain in the world with outlets spread across North America and Europe. In a recent call with suppliers, the company has realized a drastic reduction of potato production from the supplied countries, India being the one of the most producing countries.  The executive management and board of PotatoCo are really concerned with the development of lower production as it increases food prices and food insecurity. Being a low price destination food chain, they would like to apply new advanced technologies such Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to develop Climate adaptation plans.

The company called their major data science team and has asked them to look at the development of ML Model to address future risks to the business.  The goal of data science team is to develop advanced data mining processes to develop a systematic view of identifying the data sources, feature variables, synthetic variables and develop a potential model that can help to forecast. The goal is to understand the impact of climate change on the production of potatoes in India and replicate across other supplying countries for the PotatoCo.
